Hi everybody!

The meaning of this blog it's pretty simple. I want to explain some interesting features I discover and I would like to have some feedbacks about them.
Finding solutions about complex issues it's a good thing but IMO, having an other point of view that can be better than mine is more better & productive.

Every articles will be written in English (as well as possible). I hope I will be able to write an article every two weeks.

To allow you to understand me a little bit more, I'm currently in five year of engineer's school [EPSI Arras](http://www.epsi.fr/).
I will finish my study in one week :) and I will work for [Wid'op](http://www.widop.com/) during a training period of six months from February.

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and hosted by [GitHub](http://github.com/).
